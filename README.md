# Backpropagation
## Purpose
The objective of the program is to implement neural network that solves boolean functions.

## Rules
- The first neural network should solve the AND and OR boolean functions.
- The second neural network should solve the XOR boolean function.

## About the program
- The program is using **perceptron** to solve the AND and OR boolean functions.
- The program is using **multi-layered neural network** to solve the XOR function. The algorithm **Backpropagation** is used for the training.

- The program is using random seed. Due to the randomization of the weights, in some cases, the weights are badly assigned and the multi-layered neural network cannot learn.

### To run the program
- Run `python3 main.py`
